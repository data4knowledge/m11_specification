# Prompt Response

I've created a complete Python package for processing ICH M11 clinical trial protocol documents. Here's a summary of what I've created:

Package Structure:
- m11_specification/ - Main package directory
- processor.py - Core processing logic
- init.py - Package initialization
- setup.py - Package setup and dependencies
- requirements.txt - Required Python packages
- Updated README.md - Comprehensive documentation
Key Features:
- Processes both Template and Technical Specifications
- Handles color-coded text interpretation
- Extracts section structure and data elements
- Creates relationships between elements and sections
- Outputs structured JSON data
- Includes logging with JSON formatting
- Error handling for file operations
Dependencies:
- PyPDF2 - PDF processing
- pdfplumber - Advanced PDF text extraction with color information
python-json-logger - JSON formatted logging

To use the package, you would need to:

Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Use the package in your code:

```
from m11_specification import M11Processor

processor = M11Processor(
    template_spec_path="/path/to/template.pdf",
    technical_spec_path="/path/to/technical.pdf"
)
results = processor.process()
````

# Or save to JSON

```
processor.save_to_json("output.json")
```

The package is ready to use. Would you like me to help you test it with your PDF files or make any adjustments to the implementation?
